{
    //start screen leads into map nodes (show all possible options?)
    //make all nodes past current column not interactable (interactable nodes should scale bigger or highlight)
    //when valid node is clicked on, (generate mode method) which fires the respective script for generating the parameters of the node
    //i.e. level manager creates the fight scene --- tribute manager creates the tribute scene
    
    //todo: 
    //create placeholder scenes --- for each type of scenario
    //the generateMode method --- which actually place the values/options into the placeholder assets
    //for example; there will be two torch icons with placeholder text underneath, the generateTribute scene method should edit the text
    //from a range of options (weighted list/array) that replaces the placeholder
    //list of parameters to weight --- tribute buffs/stats/weapons
